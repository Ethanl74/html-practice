     paragraphs are an example of block elements because, by default,
     they take up the entire width of the web page and add space at the top
     and bottom of the element
    -->
    <p>This web page shows the difference between block and inline elements!</p>
    <!--
     anchors are an example of inline elements because, by default they 
     only take up the space that they need to.

     we showed the difference between block and inline elements using developer tools
     which we accessed by using Ctrl+Shift+I. Developer tools is useful to help you show you the
     exact code that is used to display a specific element and can show you the width,
     hight, and spacing around an element.

    <!--this in an example of an image tag. 
    the src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
    the src attribute can be an internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com
    but the best practice is to have your own images folder than stores all the images you use on your website

    NOTE: img is a self closing tag
